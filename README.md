# Magento-2-Inventory-Sync-SOAP-API

Inventory management is an important factor for all kinds of businesses and the main cause for some of the failed startups is because of no inventory management. For the stores with an abundant number of products and those who sell on multiple platforms, it becomes a complex task to maintain the inventory. It is clumsy enough to keep the product data latest. Particularly n the quantity of stock when the same product is circulated on numerous platforms. Let’s take an example of the same. Suppose the customer has placed an order at one platform and if you haven’t updated the quantity of that particular product, then the order will be placed without you having the stock.
